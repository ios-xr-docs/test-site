YANG (Yet Another Next Generation) is a data modelling language that describes data sent over a network configuration protocol (NETCONF, RESTCONF). The YANG language is used to write YANG data models.
Models are defined as text files using the YANG modelling language (RFC 7950), and are arranged in a tree structure. These models have a well-defined syntax and semantics that provides the flexibility to develop tools to process the models. They simplify network automation and orchestration, unlike CLIs that offer limited automation.
Data models provide a well-defined hierarchy of the following data on the router:
• configurational data
• operational data
• NETCONF actions
The data models are programmed to provide a common framework of configurations to be deployed across networks. This common framework helps to program and manage a network with ease.
